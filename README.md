# Hi and welcome to The Secret game.

## Purpose:
To help a group of people test their ideas against each other, which fosters competition. Then switching to cooperative mode to find the most usable solution. The last move is to name what you've decided.

## Reason:
I am bipolar and I am loud and proud about it. It lets me focus intensely on a problem. I can, if I wanted to, literally work myself to death. I invented this game to tell my truths to a group of friends, but the truth came out sooner than anticipated. I saw a larger use for this game, so I am releasing to the world under the creative commons licensing system. As this is a code repo site it also GPLed. Finally, copyleft is an old internet joke among the educated internet crew.

## The Rules:
### Begin:
  Choose a random card and that will be "The Secret". This secret can be anything, but the premise is you are the only one that knows it and can't tell anyone. I used it to treat how to break, some of the ideas I had that were iffy. For example "I am bipolar and I have some secret that seems so weird that I don't know anybody will believe me". My personal example.

### Stage 1 - Competition: x rounds (3 is good number)
1. Each person come up with their own plan to release the secret to the world.
2. The youngest goes first, and present their plan to group. The group play devil advocate while the secret holder (SH) will defend their plan until either they lose or win on conditions decided by group.
3. Next player goes, counter-clockwise (or whatever)
End of stage: All rounds played

### State 2 - Cooperation: x rounds
Hopefully by now, all the plans have been optimized (improved).
1. The group votes on the order of the best plans to the worst. 
2. The first place player now must defend the plan against the rest of the group.
3. Just like the competitive rounds, but now the whole team (group) loses and wins depending on everyones combined skills vs one person.
End of stage: All rounds played

### Stage 3 - Naming
This is optional, but great for startups trying to solve an issue because it give them a product name at the end.

An example of this is my non-profit project Working People Engineering People Working - WPEPW - WP3PW - PPWW3 - People Preventing World War III (http://morio.github.io/wpepw/).

## Audience
This game is pretty much good for anything that requires a plan and roll out. I took the https://www.tmp.ucsb.edu/ course for almost all of the 11 years. When it started it wasn't even TMP, but a small program to help people wanting to learn about start ups (2001 ~ 2002). I went to UCSB for a CE BS 2011 degree (B.S. Computer Engineering). I doubt I passed any of the course. Between going to school and surviving bipolar disorder, I tried to start a company while I was working at a now closed place. I think they got bought out, which would of helped the owner and the main developer working at the company. 

I did orders and fixed art work. I also designed a few business cards (a lot). But I was just hovering around 20 at the time, not mature enough to take on that task. Today I run Setechi.com - Sakaguchi Technologies Inc. I am the only employee as of yet but I will hire anybody I can afford that wishes to work on not only my initiatives but bettering themselves as a human. Like back when HP was a startup. This idea of constant movement, people lose sight that really their employer is simply their career. And if we just took care of our employees they won't be as stressed out as I was when trying to earn a PhD as fast as possible.

I hope this gamification of a basic group thought experiment was helpful in your life as much as it was in mine.

Thank you,
